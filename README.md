## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had some major learnings while working through this project. Here are some code samples:


```css
ul{
    list-style-type: none;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 25px 0;
    border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
}
.card h2:hover{
    color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```
Through this project, I got to learn more on how to work with the <ul> in CSS and also how to use :hover in my code.

### Continued development

The areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects include:
- Using flexbox and how to represent an element as a child of another element in CSS.
- Learning on how to center and align elements.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-an-image-in-css/) - This helped me to learn how to center an image vertically using CSS in my code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
